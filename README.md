# Floor Is Lava
The floor is now lava and will hurt to stand on. You're only hope is to stay off the ground by wallrunning or slide hopping, if you don't mind a burnt but.

## Features

The damage the "lava" will do to you scales based on the difficulty. (I recommend easy)

This mod is still in beta, so not all levels are completable. If you have problems getting past a particular part in a level, let me know by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/taskinoz/Floor-Is-Lava/issues).
